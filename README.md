YAPH is a web project, currently in progress.


Tech stack
---
* npm to handle javascript dependencies
* Babel transforms the ES6 JavaScript that we will be writing into ES5 JavaScript that current browsers can understand.
* Webpack bundles all your JavaScript together into a single file. This includes each JavaScript file that you write as well as your npm packages. A single .js file is easier to deploy and will usually download faster than multiple small files.
* We'll be using Express as our server.
* react to build the UI
